Howdy Partners 👋

My Name is Owen Woodward and I'm a student at CodeWorks. I'm an Air Force veteran and current student at Boise State University. I have always been fascinated by software development since my first time using a computer at 8 years old. You never understand how amazing and complex technology really is until you try to develop software yourself. I took the plunge into full stack development May of 2022, and have enjoyed the struggle thus far.
