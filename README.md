Howdy Partners ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Owen Woodward and I'm a student at CodeWorks. I'm an Air Force veteran and current student at Boise State University. I have always been fascinated by software development since my first time using a computer at 8 years old. You never understand how amazing and complex technology really is until you try to develop software yourself. I took the plunge into full stack development May of 2022, and have enjoyed the struggle thus far. My current hobbies include being an avid gym goer and hockey watcher. 

--  My coding experiences and languages listed below and always be evolving.

-- ðŸ”­ Currently working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and Mongo DB.  

-- ðŸŒ± Will eventually be getting into C#, Vue.js, MySQL
